Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

I recently developed a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer would purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I trained and evaluated the model, uncovering valuable insights into customer decision-making patterns.

This project enhanced my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and model interpretation, showcasing how predictive analytics can drive business strategies.

Excited to continue exploring innovative ways to leverage data for impactful solutions!
